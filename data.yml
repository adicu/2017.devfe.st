faq:
  - question: "What is DevFest?"
    answer: "DevFest is a week-long learnathon that culminates in an 18-hour hackathon. DevFest focuses on fostering community
      and helping new developers end the week with a completed project. ADI hosts DevFest every Spring."
  - question: "Who can participate?"
    answer: "Any student from the Columbia community (SEAS, CC, Barnard, General
      Studies, or any of the graduate schools) can register and participate."
  - question: "Do I need experience? What will I learn at DevFest?"
    answer: "Students of ALL experience levels are welcome! If you've never programmed
      before, the Beginner Track is perfect for you. The Beginner Track will teach you how to build your own website, and requires no prior programming experience.
      If you do have prior experience, sharpen your skillset by working on the Web Development Track, iOS Development
      Track, or Data Science Track."
  - question: "What is the DevSpace?"
    answer: "The DevSpace, located in Carleton Commons, is where you can work on any of the 4 DevFest Tracks with the help of TAs and peers.
            The DevSpace will be open 8 - 11 pm, Monday through Thursday."
  - question: "What are the DevFest Tracks?"
    answer: "The DevFest Tracks are a collection of self-paced comprehensive online tutorials in a variety of technical subjects.
            Each track teaches you how to build a fully-functional project from start to finish. We are offering 4 tracks this year: Beginner, Web Development, iOS Development, and Data Science."
  - question: "Do I have to come to the entire week?"
    answer: "No, but be sure to register and attend as many events as you can.
      We will have different company sponsors, tech electives, and fun activities every
      night, so come to as many as you can!"
  - question: "Will there be food?"
    answer: "Yes! There will be dinner served every night and food throughout the hackathon!
      If you have any food allergies, make sure to state them when you register, or just email us."
  - question: "Do I need a team or idea to sign up?"
    answer: "No! Just come with a willingness to learn something new :)"
  - question: "How big can my hackathon team be?"
    answer: "The maximum team size is 5."
  - question: "What if I don't have a team?"
    answer: "Don't worry! At the start of the hackathon, we'll hold a team-formation session."
